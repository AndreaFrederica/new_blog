# GNU Free Documentation License 1.3 (GFDL 1.3)

## Overview

The GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL) is a copyleft license published by the Free Software Foundation, specifically designed for documentation, manuals, and other textual works.

**Version:** 1.3, November 3, 2008  
**Official URL:** https://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl-1.3.html

## Core Philosophy

The purpose of GFDL is to make documents "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute them, with or without modifications, either commercially or noncommercially.

## What You Can Do

### ‚úÖ Verbatim Copying

- Copy and distribute the document in any medium
- For commercial or noncommercial purposes
- Must preserve license, copyright notices, and license notice

### ‚úÖ Modifications

- Create and distribute modified versions
- Add, remove, or change content
- Translate into other languages
- **Requirement: Modified versions must also use GFDL license**

### ‚úÖ Combining Documents

- Combine multiple GFDL documents into one
- Preserve all Invariant Sections

## Key Requirements

### üìù What Must Be Preserved

- **Copyright Notices** - All original copyright information
- **License Text** - Complete GFDL license
- **Invariant Sections** - If any exist, must remain unchanged
- **Cover Texts** - Front-Cover Text (max 5 words) and Back-Cover Text (max 25 words)

### üîÑ Modified Version Requirements

When creating modified versions, you must:

- Use a title distinct from the original document
- List authors of modifications on the title page
- Add appropriate copyright notice for modifications
- Preserve "History" section and add modification record
- Preserve all Invariant Sections
- Remove any "Endorsements" sections

### üö´ Restrictions

- **Cannot alter Invariant Sections** - These must remain as-is
- **Cannot remove copyright information** - All copyright notices must be preserved
- **Modified versions must use GFDL** - Cannot use other licenses

## Special Concepts

### üìã Invariant Sections

- Special sections designated by the original author
- Content cannot be modified, but formatting can be changed
- Typically include acknowledgments, history, etc.

### üìñ Transparent Format

Documents should be provided in transparent formats, including:

- Plain ASCII text
- Texinfo input format
- LaTeX input format
- SGML or XML using publicly available DTD
- Standard HTML, PostScript, or PDF

### üîí Opaque Format

Includes proprietary formats such as:

- Formats readable only by proprietary word processors
- Machine-generated HTML, PostScript, or PDF

## Use Cases

### ‚úÖ Content Suitable for GFDL

- **Technical Documentation** - Software manuals, API documentation
- **Educational Materials** - Tutorials, guides
- **Reference Materials** - Dictionaries, encyclopedia entries
- **Open Source Project Documentation** - README files, user guides

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Scenarios Requiring Consideration

- **Wikipedia-style Collaboration** - CC BY-SA might be more suitable
- **Commercial Documentation** - Not suitable if you don't want competitors to use it
- **Simple Blog Posts** - Might be overly complex

## License Compatibility

### üîÑ CC BY-SA Compatibility

GFDL 1.3 added one-way compatibility with Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0:

- Qualifying GFDL content can be relicensed as CC BY-SA
- But CC BY-SA content cannot be relicensed as GFDL

### üö´ Incompatible Licenses

- Proprietary licenses
- Most other open source licenses (unless explicitly compatible)

## Termination

If you violate the license terms:

- Your rights automatically terminate
- Rights may be restored if violation ceases within 60 days
- Rights permanently restored if violation is cured within 30 days

## Practical Usage Guidelines

### üìù How to Apply GFDL

Include the following notice in your document:

```
Copyright (C) YEAR YOUR NAME
Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
Free Documentation License".
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

- **Carefully consider Invariant Sections** - Once designated, they cannot be changed
- **Keep documentation updated** - Ensure license information is correct
- **Provide transparent formats** - Facilitate modification by others

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What's the difference between GFDL and GPL?**
A: GPL is for software code, GFDL is for documentation. Both are copyleft licenses but apply to different types of works.

**Q: Can GFDL documents be used commercially?**
A: Yes, GFDL allows commercial use, but requires maintaining the same license.

**Q: If I only want to quote a few sentences, do I need to follow GFDL?**
A: Short quotations typically fall under fair use and don't require GFDL compliance. However, substantial copying does require license compliance.
